# quizMe
QuizMe is a quiz application that quizzes the individual on various topics related to Swift and Xcode. This was an application that I had to create for an IOS dev course.

# What I used
- Xcode
- Swift
- The project skeleton provided to us (image assets, background, etc)

# What I learned
I learned about Structs in Swift and how they're basically the equivalent to Classes in languages like Java. I learned about why we use Structs and why we separate our code into different comparments. I also learned about the MVC, or Model View Control design and what makes it an effective design to adhere to when creating an application. I applied those new concepts and the concepts I learned previously in Swift to create a nice, beautiful Quiz application.

# How to use
Provided above is the directory of the application. Simply clone the repository into your Xcode and you should be able to run it.
